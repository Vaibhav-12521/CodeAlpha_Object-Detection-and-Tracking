# Historical Water Quality and Station Geology Dataset
## Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) - India

### DATASET OVERVIEW

This dataset represents a comprehensive compilation of groundwater monitoring stations and historical water quality data from India's Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) network. The dataset is designed for mobile application development focused on real-time groundwater management in India.

**Data Source**: Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India
**Coverage**: National (India)
**Data Type**: Synthetic/Mock Data for Development Purposes*
**Temporal Range**: 2019-2023 (5 years of historical data)
**Spatial Coverage**: 500 representative monitoring stations across 21 Indian states

*Note: While this dataset is synthetic, it is based on actual CGWB monitoring methodologies, geological formations, and water quality patterns documented in official CGWB reports and publications.

### DATASET COMPONENTS

#### 1. Station Metadata (CGWB_Station_Metadata.csv)
- **Records**: 500 monitoring stations
- **Purpose**: Geographic and geological characteristics of monitoring locations
- **Key Fields**:
  - Station identification and location coordinates
  - Geological formation and lithology details
  - Aquifer characteristics and hydrogeological parameters
  - Installation dates and monitoring agency information

#### 2. Historical Water Quality Data (CGWB_Water_Quality_Historical.csv)
- **Records**: 5,000 water samples
- **Purpose**: Chemical analysis results for groundwater quality assessment
- **Sampling Frequency**: Bi-annual (Pre-monsoon and Post-monsoon)
- **Parameters**: 16 key water quality indicators including:
  - Physical parameters (pH, EC, TDS)
  - Major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, HCO3, SO4)
  - Health-critical parameters (Fluoride, Nitrate, Iron, Arsenic, Uranium)

#### 3. Station Quality Summary (CGWB_Station_Quality_Summary.csv)
- **Records**: 500 station summaries
- **Purpose**: Aggregated quality metrics and compliance status
- **Includes**: Long-term averages, compliance rates, monitoring statistics

### DATA STRUCTURE AND QUALITY

#### Geological Formations Represented:
1. Alluvial Plains - Quaternary sediments, high porosity
2. Basaltic Traps - Deccan traps, fractured aquifers
3. Crystalline Rocks - Archean formations, weathered/fractured zones
4. Sedimentary Rocks - Consolidated sedimentary formations
5. Coastal Sediments - Marine and fluvial deposits
6. Desert Formations - Arid zone sediments
7. Himalayan Formations - Mountain front deposits
8. Gondwana Formations - Coal-bearing sequences

#### Water Quality Standards:
All parameters are evaluated against Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS 10500) for drinking water quality:

| Parameter | Acceptable Limit | Permissible Limit | Health Concern |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| EC (µS/cm) | 750 | 3000 | Cardiovascular effects |
| Fluoride (mg/L) | 1.0 | 1.5 | Dental/skeletal fluorosis |
| Nitrate (mg/L) | 45 | - | Blue baby syndrome |
| Iron (mg/L) | 1.0 | - | Aesthetic effects |
| Arsenic (µg/L) | 10 | - | Cancer risk |
| Uranium (µg/L) | 30 | - | Kidney toxicity |
| Chloride (mg/L) | 250 | 1000 | Taste/gastric issues |

#### Data Quality Features:
- Realistic spatial distribution based on India's hydrogeology
- Seasonal variations (pre/post-monsoon) reflecting natural patterns
- Regional contamination patterns consistent with CGWB findings
- Geologically-controlled parameter distributions
- Quality assurance flags and compliance indicators

### USAGE GUIDELINES

#### Mobile Application Integration:
1. **Station Discovery**: Use coordinate data for map-based station location
2. **Quality Assessment**: Implement BIS compliance checking algorithms
3. **Trend Analysis**: Utilize historical data for temporal pattern recognition
4. **Geological Context**: Link aquifer properties to water quality patterns
5. **Alert Systems**: Set threshold-based notifications for parameter exceedances

#### Data Limitations:
- This is **synthetic/mock data** created for development purposes
- Real-time data integration requires connection to official CGWB/India-WRIS APIs
- Actual station coordinates and IDs differ from this synthetic dataset
- Water quality values are modeled based on regional patterns, not measured

#### Recommended Data Updates:
- Integrate with India-WRIS portal for real-time water level data
- Connect to CGWB's WIMS system for official quality data
- Validate geological parameters against official hydrogeological maps
- Implement data synchronization with CGWB's DWLR network
